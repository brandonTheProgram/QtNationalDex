Intimidate
Upon entering battle, the opponent’s Attack lowers one stage. In a Double Battle, both opponents’ Attack are lowered. Pokemon with the Clear Body, Hyper Cutter, or White Smoke ability are unaffected. In a link battle, if both sides switch on the same turn, and first player sends out a Pokemon with Intimidate, the opponent’s Attack will be lowered before the opponent’s Pokemon switches. Opponents in S.O.S. Battles are more likely to call for help.
