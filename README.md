This is an update of the NationalDex project to include images and gifs to make the program more user friendly. It will contain the data for Pokemon available from Kanto to Alola in the Galar region. As more Pokemon get added to the games, I will continue to update the program. This program is capable of producing data for the regions starting with Kanto and ending with the current region of the current generation. The following is an example of what the program would look like if the user picked Gengar.
